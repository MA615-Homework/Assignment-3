## Background
Hurricane Ike produced a damaging, destructive and deadly storm surge across the upper Texas and southwest Louisiana coasts. 
And it will likely end up being the third costliest natural disaster in the United States behind Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Andrew.

Over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, Ike grew in size and intensified to a category two hurricane with maximum winds of 100 mph by that evening. Ike continued to move northwest toward the Texas coast as the hurricane crossed the central and northwest Gulf of Mexico. Although Ike's intensity remained in the category 2 range, the cyclone continued to grow and became a very large hurricane. The diameter of tropical storm force winds covering a total of 425 miles from the northwest to southeast as Ike approached the upper Texas coast on Friday, September 12th. Ike made landfall at 2:10 am CDT Saturday, September 13th near Galveston, Texas. Ike was a category 2 hurricane at landfall with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph.

## Our work
We selected the data 'Ike 2008' in hurricaneexposure package, generating a series of plots on rainfall, wind and events in 7 days, which intuitively reflect the hurricane's effection around the landfall and surronding areas.In order to precisely observe the path of the hurricane, we plotted a time series chart based on the wind speed changes recorded by the buoys around the landfall. Besides, we explored the spatial continuity between points formed after the hurricane made landfall, and then fitted a spatial model of the distance from each point on the space to the hurricane landfall and the maximum rainfall before and after the hurricane's arrival. Moreover, we predicted the map of rainfall at each point on the space before and after the hurricane's arrival within the prediction intervals.
